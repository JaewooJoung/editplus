ode to editplus

OK, I thought it would be nice to see julia in another IDE. 
Thus, I made one for Editplus. For me Editplus is only IDE I have purchased in my life. 
So there. I now use Editplus and ftp files to my own server. and run it from server.
Good thing about editplus for Julia (by the way, I am not sales of Editplus but just a fan)
1. cliptext , I don't remember all the math codes because I don't practice them much
2. Syntax, I can color what I want to highlight 
3. some autocompletion is good for me because I want make a structured programming
4. template, yeah for me layed out would be nice for me to use. 

Lastly, I welcome your opinion. and any ideas, bug findings or commit as well.
